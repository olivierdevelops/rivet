# T-19 — e2e / fault (UC-18 / R22)

> **Status:** Completed
> **Created:** 2026-09-28
> **Last Updated:** 2026-09-29
> **Affected Versions:** 0.1.0, 0.2.0 (re-recorded)
> **Owner:** Project maintainer
> **Affected Components:** execution

## Purpose

open/send/read/finish/cancel across CLI/HTTP/poll/WS/MCP/library; duplicate send; stale cursor

## Validated Requirements

| Plan Requirement | Description |
|---|---|
| PLAN-2026-0001 R22 | 029–031 |
| PLAN-2026-0002 R1 | T-34 regression: every 0.1.0 suite stays green on the 0.2.0 envelopes and input keys with no behaviour change |

## Preconditions

A clean checkout of `main` at commit `14750b8` (`14750b86a157d8fbaac7443201bc0eeb30747366`, the v0.2.0 release candidate); Rust 1.90.0 from `rust-toolchain.toml`; `cargo build --workspace --all-features` run first (the FFI suites need `librivet`). Fixtures are started in-process on `127.0.0.1:0` or in temporary directories by the tests; no external services.

v0.1.0 run: commit `f15a82b`.

## Test Environment

macOS 26.4.1 arm64 (aarch64-apple-darwin), Rust 1.90.0, Apple clang 21.0.0, Python 3.9.6, cbindgen 0.29.4 (local); GitHub Actions run 36505156729 at the same commit on ubuntu-latest and macos-latest (Rust 1.90.0, Python 3.12); Windows unsupported in 0.2.0 (INC-2026-0011).

v0.1.0 run: macOS (aarch64-apple-darwin), Rust 1.90.0; Linux and Windows not executed (no CI runner: TASK-051 blocked on a git remote)

## Test Data

Test fixtures and bundles defined in `tests/conformance_sessions.rs` and the shared helpers under `tests/` (in-process servers, temporary directories).

## Procedure

```sh
cargo test --workspace --all-targets --all-features --no-fail-fast   # full run → /tmp/p3-tests.log
cargo test --all-features --test conformance_sessions
```

Tests executed (9):

- `conformance_sessions::cancel_after_completion_reports_the_terminal_state` — G28: cancelling a session that already finished reports its terminal state (succeeded / failed), even after the terminal event was acknowledged and evicted
- `conformance_sessions::cancel_ownership_and_limits` — cancel is idempotent, leaves a readable cancelled terminal event, and foreign principals see not_found
- `conformance_sessions::cursors_and_backpressure` — cursors: future cursor conflicts, evicted cursor is stream.cursor_expired, re-reading a cursor replays; producers wait for acknowledgement
- `conformance_sessions::duplex_sequence_rules_through_the_library` — one enqueue per accepted retry; changed payload and gaps conflict; finish drains input and ends `incoming`
- `conformance_sessions::host_buffer_budget_is_reserved_by_session_queues` — G8 limits.max_buffered_bytes is a host-wide budget reserved by session queues: an unread producer that would exceed it fails limit.buffered_bytes, and acknowledged events release their bytes for the next session
- `conformance_sessions::idle_sessions_expire_without_a_session_call` — G16: the background sweeper cancels a session whose idle lease expired without any session call (its run ends and releases its concurrency slot; the terminal event is cancelled.idle)
- `conformance_sessions::open_honours_a_requested_deadline` — G16: sessions.open accepts deadline_ms (capped by the host at 600000); a session whose run outlives it ends with a terminal timeout error
- `conformance_sessions::polling_routes_drive_a_duplex_session` — polling input/finish_input/cancel routes drive a duplex session; unknown sessions are 404, conflicts 409
- `conformance_sessions::session_operations_through_the_dispatcher` — the rivet.sessions.* registry operations drive the same sessions through the dispatcher (CLI/HTTP/MCP path)

v0.1.0 run: `cargo test conformance_sessions`.

## Expected Results

Ordered, bounded, principal-bound

## Actual Results

### v0.2.0 run (2026-09-29, commit `14750b8`)

9 passed, 0 failed, 0 ignored on macOS at commit `14750b8` (v0.2.0 release candidate). This is the PLAN-2026-0002 T-34 regression: the 0.1.0 suite passes on the 0.2.0 envelopes and input keys (TASK-018 changed only request and response shapes). Green on ubuntu-latest and macos-latest in CI run 36505156729, which runs the same `cargo test --workspace --all-targets --all-features --no-fail-fast`.

### v0.1.0 run (2026-09-28, commit `f15a82b`)

9 passed, 0 failed, 0 ignored.

## Result

PASS

Windows is not a supported platform in 0.2.0 (maintainer decision, [INC-2026-0011](../incidents/active/inc-2026-0011-windows-port-failures.md)), so it is not a reason for a PARTIAL result.

v0.1.0 run: PASS.

## Evidence

v0.2.0 run:

```text
conformance_sessions               test result: ok. 9 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 4.41s

GitHub Actions run 36505156729 (commit 14750b8, conclusion: success)
  test (ubuntu-latest)  success    test (macos-latest)  success
  features (none|serve|grpc|quic|oauth|cli)  success ×6    deny  success
```

v0.1.0 run:

```text
test result: ok. 9 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 4.38s
```

## Evidence Sources

- The commands above, run at commit `14750b8`; full-suite output in `/tmp/p3-tests.log` (493 passed, 0 failed), read with `grep -E "test result|FAILED|panicked"`.
- Test source: `tests/conformance_sessions.rs`.
- CI: [run 36505156729](https://github.com/olivierdevelops/rivet/actions/runs/36505156729) at the same commit (`test (ubuntu-latest)`, `test (macos-latest)`, six `features` jobs, `deny`: all `success`).

v0.1.0 run:

- Command above, run at commit `f15a82b`.
- Test source: `tests/conformance_sessions.rs`.
